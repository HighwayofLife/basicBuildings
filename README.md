# FreeCol Mod
This is a [FreeCol](http://www.freecol.org/) Mod. FreeCol is a turn-based strategy game based on the old game Colonization, and similar to Civilization. The objective of the game is to create an independent nation. You start with only a few colonists defying the stormy seas in their search for new land.

# Basic Buildings
This Mod makes a colony entirely blank except for a carpenter house, depot, and pasture. Effectively making each building within a colony a requirement to build before it can be used. This puts a much bigger emphasis on being able to build buildings and is more 'realistic' for an colonial times. An important note about the Town Hall. Since it is required to produce liberty bells, you will not be able to recruit a chosen founding father until you build a town hall. Likewise with a chapel, being required to produce crosses. Thus this mod increases production of the chapel, church, cathedral, and also increases production of the Town Hall to offset the increased time and building requirement.
